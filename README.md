# Amazon Q CLI with MCP Demo

This is a demo project to showcase Amazon Q CLI with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

It explores various configurations of mcp servers. For this, the [weather MCP http server](./weather-mcp-hhtp-server/README.md) has been created (using FastAPI as a proxy to weather.com api)

For a presentation of the experience building this project, refer to the [logbook](./logbook-presentation.md)
